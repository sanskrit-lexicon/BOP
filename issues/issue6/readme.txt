# File2. BOP_main-L2.txt

This file, posted by Andhrabharati, is taken from https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/40#issuecomment-1118859363 dated 5 May 2022.

# Goal

Study File2 and see what are the changes which require to be brought to File1.
Once File1 has all the changes required, the same has to be carried back to csl-orig via the script https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/blob/main/scripts/carry_changes_to_cslorig.sh from csl-devanagari repository.

# Challenges

Andhrabharati has removed the line breaks from the definition.
BOP at CDSL has line breaks. 
It does help when one looks at printed dictionary to locate the line number.
Therefore, it needs to be preserved
